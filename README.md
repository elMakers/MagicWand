# MagicWand

## Instructions

Not much here yet- just wave your wand around!

For now you can pull the trigger to test projectiles, but this is WIP and the mechanics will change.

## Building

Building this requires the standard MagicLeap assets as well as the Unity post-processing pipeline.

Both of these have been .gitignored.
